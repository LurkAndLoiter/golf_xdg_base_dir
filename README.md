# Golf Plugin

Golf Plugin is a Vim plugin that brings a challenge-based keystroke game to your editor. Inspired by the idea of code golfing, each challenge tasks you with transforming a starting text into a target text by typing as few keystrokes as possible. Your performance is dynamically tracked and scored in real time, and upon completion, you get a detailed summary along with a leaderboard.

  - Calculates your score based on how many keystrokes you use relative to the par.

- **Auto-Verification:**  
  - Automatically compares your current buffer content against the target text.
  - Displays a success message as soon as your solution matches the target, with detailed stats.

- **Visual Feedback & Leaderboard:**

## Installation

### Using a Plugin Manager

If you use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), add the following lines to your `~/.vimrc` or `init.vim`:

```vim
Plug 'vuciv/golf'
```

Then run the command:
```
:PlugInstall
```

### Manual Installation
Copy the golf.vim file into your Vim runtime path (typically ~/.vim/plugin/).

## Usage

### Starting a Challenge

**Play Today's Challenge:**
In Vim, run:
```
:GolfToday
```

This command:
- Saves your current buffer.
- Fetches the daily challenge from the API.
- Opens a new buffer with the challenge text and a side-by-side split showing the target text.
- Begins tracking your keystrokes.

**Play a Random Challenge by Difficulty:**
In Vim, run:
```
:Golf <difficulty>
```
Where `<difficulty>` is one of `easy`, `medium`, or `hard` (case-insensitive).

Examples:
```
:Golf easy
:Golf medium
:Golf hard
```
This command fetches a random challenge matching the specified difficulty.

**Play a Random Challenge (Any Difficulty):**
In Vim, run:
```
:Golf
```
This command fetches a completely random challenge, regardless of difficulty.

**Play a Random Challenge by Tag:**
In Vim, run:
```
:Golf tag <tag-name>
```
Example:
```
:Golf tag regex
:Golf tag "multi line"
```
This command fetches a random challenge that includes the specified tag.

**Play a Challenge from a Specific Date:**
In Vim, run:
```
:Golf date <YYYY-MM-DD>
```
Example:
```
:Golf date 2023-10-27
```
This command fetches the daily challenge designated for the specified date.

**Keystroke Tracking & Auto-Verification:**
Every keystroke is recorded. The plugin continuously compares your edited buffer against the target text. When your solution matches perfectly, a success screen is shown with statistics including the stroke count, time taken, and your score relative to par.

**Exiting the Challenge:**
After reviewing the success and leaderboard screen, press any key to exit, and the plugin will return you to your original file.
